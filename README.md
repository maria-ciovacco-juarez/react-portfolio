## React Portfolio

## Description

With this challenge, I made a portfolio completely from scratch using React. 

## Installation

No installation, just check out the deployed link -->. https://relaxed-raindrop-7ae599.netlify.app/

## Usage

In my portfolio you will find some projects I've done, whether on my own, or collaborations with my fellow students. You will also find:

-- An 'About' page

-- Social media links in the footer

-- A link to download my resume (example resume)

-- Contact page (still running into errors, but it looks nice)

-- mobile-friendly
